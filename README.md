# CKD_Classification_ML
this project is about detecting Chronic Kidney Disease as a machine learning project 

First we imported the dataset and we used quantile method to deal with outliers , and KNNImputer to deal with missing values , in order to find the best k for knn , grid search was the best method for hyperparameter tuning  , then we used KNN , SVM and nb as classification methods
